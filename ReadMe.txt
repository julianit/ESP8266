As many other curious developers, I decided to explore the hardware devices that provide
some solutions for IoT. ESP8266 is one of the best small and WiFi cheap hardware device
I have found. It is a lot of fun and personal satisfaction when I make it work.
As every beggining it is very difficult to setup a working environment an understand the
whole big picture, but I finaly made it.
At this section I will post some very simple examples that I find usefull for begginers
in this area, just like me. I use ESP8266 E12 and SDK 2, but you can use any other 
version.
